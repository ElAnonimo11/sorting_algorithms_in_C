Is a joke project with my self of publish C algorithms of sort, use my code if you want
The examples are only of integers beacuase are the easier in C, you can do it similarly with other types

using C99, to easy variables

bubble sort:      O(n^2) in time, O(1) in space
insertion sort:   O(n^2) in time, O(1) in space
